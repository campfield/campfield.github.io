      <description>Professional Biography For over twenty years I&amp;rsquo;ve worked as a professional computer scientist with a focus on Linux systems administration. Within systems administration my focus has been infrastructure systems and development of distribution-agnostic configuration management solutions using Puppet, Ansible, virtualization, containers, the HashiCorp suite, and both open-source and vendor-designed technologies.
I&amp;rsquo;m currently engaged as a Senior Systems Administrator with Leidos, my team working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&amp;rsquo;s (CDC) bioinformatics and high-performance scientific computing (HPC) group.</description>
