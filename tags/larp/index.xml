      <description>Mythre is a basic LARP designed for simplicity and originally targeted towards younger players (ages 10 - 17). At its core, Mythre is for live-action, dramatic storytelling where the rules are there to help build upon a character but not get in the way of the players actually telling their stories.
Mythre itself consists of the basic rules covering character&amp;rsquo;s enchanted races and their special in-game abilities, from magic to combat.</description>
