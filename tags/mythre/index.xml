      <description>Mythre LARP is a basic LARP designed for simplicity targeted towards younger players (ages 10 - 17). At its core, Mythre is for live-action, dramatic storytelling where the rules are there to help build upon the story.
Mythre itself consists of the basic rules covering characters playing enchanted races and their special in-game abilities, from magic to combat. There isn&amp;rsquo;t a lot of front and back-matter that is present in other LARP handbooks because this isn&amp;rsquo;t a game designed for 50+ players who need every possible in and out-of-game condition covered.</description>
