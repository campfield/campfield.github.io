      <description>There are no perfect resumes, however, there are plenty of horrible resumes.
Over the years, I&amp;rsquo;ve become a go-to resource for taking friends&amp;rsquo; resumes and covering them with the battle scars of an anal-retentive judge of Oxford commas, mismatched styles, and bewildering capitalization.
This talk covers the obvious, and not so obvious, errors that I encounter in every resume, including my own, that make an instant difference between it being recycled and scheduling an on-site interview.</description>

      <description>Say hello to my friends Vagrant and Packer, the one-two punch combo for those who yearn for a tougher, leaner, and meaner virtual machine provisioning and deployment process. If this honey-badger hybrid from Hashicorp sounds appealing to you, then buckle in as we take you from raw ISO to virtual machine cluster in under 60 minutes.</description>

      <title>Serving up virtualization two different ways (with a side of hash tags).</title>

      <description>This talk covers the use and abuse of NFS-Root technologies, combined with Linux Containers (LXC), to bring up a virtualization cluster with all the bells and whistles of VMware and OpenStack, but without the heavy pricetag, skill investment, while retaining all the benefits of open-source.
We walk through the basics of NFS-Root, creating and serving custom thin hypervisors served via PXE and creating KVM and LXC images to run on our diskless hypervisors.</description>
